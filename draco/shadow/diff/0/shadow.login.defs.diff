+# Most of these groups are self-explanatory, with the possible

+# easily as well, so it's a good idea to turn HAL on for any
+# machine that will be used from the console.
+#
+# Note that users are added to these default groups only when
+# logging into a shell with /bin/login, not when using a login
+# manager such as kdm.  In that case, users who should have
+# hardware access must be added to the appropriate groups
