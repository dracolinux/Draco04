DracoLinux 0.4
==============

Latest DracoLinux 0.4 release was back in 2012. But this version still has value, and will be maintained for i486 compatible computers for some years still, and there may be a new release in the future (security/bug fixes first). Note that DracoLinux 0.5 and 1.0 are still in (slow) development, they are 64bit-only at the moment.
