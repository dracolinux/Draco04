# devo dialogrc stanard scheme

# basic color scheme
# color = ( foreground, background, foreground_bright )
#
#	screen_color:	black background
#			does foreground + highlite affect -anything- ? 
#			i don't think so ...
#	dialog_color:	low intensity white panel with black text;
#			might use different dialog_color for special purpose,
#			eg, use (RED,WHITE,ON) for 'error' messages
#	title_color:	should generally match dialog_color
#			might use different title_color for special purpose,
#			eg, use (RED,WHITE,ON) for 'error' messages
#	border_color:	(foreground,background) should match dialog_color
#			background, with foreground bright.  nothing else
#			seems to make sense.
